# User Input Age Calculator

# Step 1: Prompt user for their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Step 2: Calculate age in 2050
years_until_2050 = 2050 - 2023  # 27 years
age_in_2050 = current_age + years_until_2050

# Step 3: Print the result
print(f"In 2050, you will be {age_in_2050} years old.")
